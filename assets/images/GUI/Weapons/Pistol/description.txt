Does this even need introduction? Alright, then.
The most popular Atlesian sidearm, the SPC1 Pistol. Heavily modifiable, though already perfect. 
Well-balanced, which means it can be dual-wielded, especially by our Knight. Well-made, which 
means it's dependable enough to be entrusted to a robot. Well-designed, as in "somewhat based
on Big Iron's own guns."
Can't go wrong with this.
