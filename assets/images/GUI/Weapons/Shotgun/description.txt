Shotguns. Yeah, I got shotguns. Had to call in a favor with one of the Schnees' top security guys
who is an old pal of mine (no wonder their security is so lax. Just don't tell anyone I said that).
He sent me this pump-action beauty. I think he said something about an automatic version being in
development by them. You should look into it. And do me a favor, DON'T LET IT OUT OF YOUR
SIGHT. It's bad enough losing common equipment in train raids. I don't need prototypes in the hands
of insane animals.
