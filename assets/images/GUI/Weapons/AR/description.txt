Right. A9. I figured, if we're making a cutting-edge design here, might as well ditch the standard mil-spec
equipment and go for cutting-edge weaponry. This right here is not only yet to hit the shelves, even the
AceOps haven't seen it yet. Though knowing how "secure" our blacksite transports are, I wouldn't be 
surprised if those half-animal terrorists (aka White Fang) already have a crate of A9s. 
Snide remarks aside, I think this'll fit our Experimental nicely. And there's still room for improvement,
in which you R&D people will find some good entertainment for yourselves
