The SRX - Sniper Rifle, Experimental, is an in-house side project. This weapon is unique,
befitting a real Huntsman, never to hit the shelves. Probably never to be heard of by
anyone who isn't working on Project AKX, which is a pity, since this rifle is 
a staggering piece of technology. An innovative in-stock shock absorption system
will compensate for some of the recoil, there's quite a bit of space in case we
want to introduce some sort of a backup form and the railings on the barrel will
allow us to balance the weapon out. It's a pity we're working in secret. Maybe I
should sneak this rifle off to Steale, she'll like it.
