Entry 32

We have finally managed to create a shield system for the AKX. 
Hard-Light Dust doesn't care which part of the structure it created is hit. Therefore
we need to make it smaller rather than bigger, otherwise we're stuck with Dust-consuming
segments that protect nothing and if a stray claw hits it, the entire shield is down.
That means we're much better off if we can use lots of small Hard-Light shields instead of 
just one big shield. That way we can make it exactly the size of the body and we can 
manage some of the smaller shields going down while others stay on. Better yet, we
can turn them on just before the hit, reducing overall Dust usage.
But how to we dispense the Dust? 
The answer lies within our own bodies. The way humans perspire, AKX will be able to
protect itself. Lots of really small holes all over the body, "pores", if you will,
each using just a little Hard-Light Dust. The only problem is, turning on too many of
those "pores" at once will overload the whole system, and without its shields, AKX
is nothing more that a well-armed tin can. I guess we can implement a flight response
if that happens, but that's not my field of expertise. I'm an engineer, not a code 
monkey. Note to self - talk to the IT crowd about that.
