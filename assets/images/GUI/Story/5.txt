Entry 6

AKX. Atlesian Knight Experimental. I decided that since we're using the AK-130 as the base, 
we should reflect that in the name. Continuity and such.
Right. Racist though he is, Goldstein's useful. He managed to get me a shipment of Hard-Light 
Dust, enough to work with. Guess that's why they keep him on the job.
Huntsmen have Aura, right? But Aura is a product of a human's soul, not present in a machine. 
That's why all previous AKs utilize swarm tactics, they're too brittle to be used one at a time.
Nothing to protect them. 135's have shields, but a shield is no replacement for Aura. 
Hard-Light Dust might be the solution, if we can create a shield with it, an armour that covers
most of AKX's body. Of course, it'll need to restock the supplies once in a while, but the same
can be said about any human being.
