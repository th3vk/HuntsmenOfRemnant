Dr. Krasinski's Journal - project AKX

Entry 35

How do you instruct a robot to choose its own weapon, let alone make one?
We've got a bit of every kingdom's armaments now, we're developing some
prototypes here on site, that means we can test the AKX with every type of weapon
there is. But a true Hunter doesn't use mass-produced weapons. We can't just
give every AKX a pistol, that would just make them the next generation of 130's
and that is not the goal of the project. 
We could randomize the process, but Hunters don't choose their weapons at random.
We could just upload the test data and let the AI choose, but the choice will
always be the same, because the data will always be the same, that much I know.
