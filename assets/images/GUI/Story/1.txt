CONNECTED TO ATLAS HOME BASE

BLACKSITE: Good morning, Home Base. Anything for us?

HOMEBASE: What's up, Krasinski. Yeah, got a message from the General himself.
I guess he finally found some use for you.

BLACKSITE: Spare me your bickering, Goldstein. It's enough that no
Faunus personnel here will communicate with Home Base if you're 
on comm duty.

HOMEBASE: Ain't you who has to fill in three hours worth of paperwork
every time those terrorists steal something from us. You oughta try it
someday, maybe you'll come to see my point. Anyway, did ya receive the
package?

BLACKSITE: If by "package" you mean a unit of 130-s, then yes, those
tin cans are here.

HOMEBASE: Nice, means Logistics didn't mess up once for a change. Read
the General's message and then get to work. The General wants his new 
project to be ready before the next Vytal Festival, gives you 
roughly a year to get it done. Also got some bad news for you - if you
need anything you'll have to come to me.

BLACKSITE: Great. That'll lift the spirits up.
