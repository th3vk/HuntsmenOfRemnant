HOMEBASE: What can I do you for, Krasinski?

BLACKSITE: You can feed me info, Goldstein. What did the others
ask for?

HOMEBASE: Blondies got a crate more of 130-s and a couple 135-s,
the shielded ones. 

BLACKSITE: Expected. Nickel has come to the same conclusion as me,
with only a year's time we can only iterate on what we have.
Get some better AI, arm the thing with something more than a blade,
maybe something more. What's Polendina's move?

HOMEBASE: Don't know. He requested nothing.

BLACKSITE: Nothing? Can't be. 

HOMEBASE: I'm not kidding you here, he requested nothing.

BLACKSITE: Maybe he's still thinking. Meanwhile, I have some ideas.
How much Hardlight Dust can you lay your hands on?

HOMEBASE: I wouldn't be Quartermaster if the answer wasn't "all of it"

BLACKSITE: Finally, something good comes out of your mouth. Send it.
