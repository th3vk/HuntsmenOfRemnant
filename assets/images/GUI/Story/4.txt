STEALE: Whaddaya want, egghead?

BLACKSITE: So you're the Specialist they assigned to us?

STEALE: Who else would it be?

BLACKSITE: Alright. Do you like travel?

STEALE: It's in the job description. If I wanted to stay in
Atlas, I'd join the police.

BLACKSITE: You've been briefed about our project, have you not?

STEALE: Yeah. Don't know what I've got to do with any of it though.

BLACKSITE: We can't simply write a letter to Ozpin saying "we need to
take a look at your weapons", now can we?

STEALE: True enough.

BLACKSITE: We'll also need you to catch Grimm.

STEALE: Didn't catch that last one. Did you say "Catch Grimm"?

BLACKSITE: Yes, catch Grimm, that's correct.

STEALE: What for? You better be paying me triple for this. 
Catching them isn't exactly the same as killing them.

BLACKSITE: To test the project. We can't risk flashing it in
the tundra or somewhere in the desert. That, and we need to 
be able to control the flow of Grimm.

STEALE: Uh, understood. Anything else I need to know?

BLACKSITE: Not at this time. We'll contact you when we need
you.
