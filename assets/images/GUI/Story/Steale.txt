PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSESSMENT
Vale-born. Comes from a poor family. That explains the greed and the 
choice of Atlas instead of Beacon.
Became a Huntress because, quote: "It's an easy buck for a good bang".
Possible sadistic tendencies?
Doesn't shy away from dirty work, wetwork, deniable operations.
Low moral standards. Dismissive, but loyal.
