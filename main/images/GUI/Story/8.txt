STEALE: Which my bank account does just as well

BLACKSITE: And to give you another task

STEALE: Of course you have an ask. So ask.

BLACKSITE: I need you to check the work progress at GINGER site.

STEALE: Spying on our own? Why?

BLACKSITE: We're on a tight schedule. We have a problem and I'm afraid we can't 
solve it without outside help.

STEALE: So ask the guys at GINGER yourself. Why the secrecy?

BLACKSITE: Because Polendina will ask for something in return.

STEALE: And you don't want him to succeed?

BLACKSITE: I want me to succeed.

STEALE: Right. Sure. Whatever gets me a skyscraper apartment.

BLACKSITE: If AKX is a success, you'll be able to buy two.
