BLACKSITE: Is that a joke?

HOMEBASE: No, Krasinski, it is not. He wants a robo-Huntsman.

BLACKSITE: In a year? How? 

HOMEBASE: Your job to figure out, not mine. You've got unlimited funding
though. Also a personal Specialist, in case you need some other kingdom to
"share" their tech. 

BLACKSITE: Great. Anyone else given the same task? I know Big Iron well 
enough to know that he's got someone else on this too, in case we can't
make it.

HOMEBASE: I'm not supposed to tell you this.

BLACKSITE: You're also not supposed to sell military equipment to civilians.

HOMEBASE: They need to defend themselves-

BLACKSITE: They've got Huntsmen for that. But you're not talking about the 
Grimm, are you?

HOMEBASE: Don't. 

BLACKSITE: I'm going to ask nicely once more. Is anyone else working on
this kind of task?

HOMEBASE: Yes. Nickel's guys on "BLOND" and Polendina's "GINGER".

BLACKSITE: Can you get me a gun?

HOMEBASE: Planning to shoot yourself?

BLACKSITE: No. We'll need guns. Lots of guns.
