Vacuans. Those "everything to survive" kinda people know how to make weapons, that's for sure. 
This battle rifle is simple and very effective. But most of all, it's dirt cheap - almost no
moving parts, bullets can be propelled by everything from Fire Dust to wielder's own Semblance,
and if the blowback jams (because of the damned sand, I guess), you can pump it with the handle.
But the cherry on top? The integrated silencer. Hell if I know what for they made it, but if we're ever 
planning to deploy AKX-es against non-Grimm, it'll be useful.
Also, the name "Sand Whisper" is damn near poetic. Which screams "vacuan design" more than anything.
