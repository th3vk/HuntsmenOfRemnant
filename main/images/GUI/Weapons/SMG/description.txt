What you fine gentlemen have here is typical Vale weaponry. This SMG is light, it's 
concealable and it's very, very versatile. It also looks nice - despite being 
mass-produced, it doesn't look as crude and, may I say, industrial, as our guns.
The upper railing adds a nice touch and the folding stock is useful if you want to
hide a melee weapon underneath it. No wonder Beacon students usually show the most
difference in their weapon choices.
