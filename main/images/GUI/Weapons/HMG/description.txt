Another Vale specimen: a Heavy Machine Gun. I can see where this one
comes from (spoiler: our own Manta door guns), but it's been reworked
so much you almost can't recognize it. The only stock Atlas parts left
are the bipod and the pistol grip. Everything else is homegrown Vale 
stuff. The fun part? It can be both belt-fed and magazine-fed, which
is the very essence of Vale-type versatility.
Oh, yeah, the recoil's pretty hard. You might need to reinforce 
your robot's arms.
