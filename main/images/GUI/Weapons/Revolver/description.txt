Guess what I found? That's right, an SPC1, hand-stolen by Mistralians and remade into a revolver.
Which is kind of ironic, if you ask me, since our boss' arms (not THEM arms) are cylinder-loaded.
Great minds think alike, I guess. That, or we should start mass-producing revolvers. Anyway,
it's hard for me to say if it's an improvement, you know I prefer bigger guns, but it's curious
enough for me to send it to you eggheads. Dunno what they call it, so I labeled it as an "SPC1" too.
